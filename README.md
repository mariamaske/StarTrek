# StarTrek

## Dataset:
The original data set comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birkoruzicka/startrekdialoguetranscripts 
It contains the script of all Star Trek series and episodes until April 2020. 
The existing data set was manually supplemented by me with data such as gender, frequency of appearance and role to enable a deeper analysis. 

## Datacleaning:
The data cleaning was done with the help of Python. 

## Data Information:
Only characters that have a speaking part and a linecount of at least 5 lines are included in the data set and therefore in this analysis.
